Next up is Lake Toya, a caldera lake formed by a large volcanic eruption over 100,000 years ago. Its water is rich in minerals. This bountiful nature makes it home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. Gaze at the glass-like surface of the lake as you enjoy lunch at Toyako Manseikaku. Mt. Usu, the first designated UNESCO Global Geopark  in Japan, is on the way, and once at the summit you can get amazing views in the fresh air. Snap photos of the other mountains and the open ranges.",

You'll get to eat typical Osaka food, have a few drinks, frolic with the locals, and have all sorts of fun along the way! Your guide will be a native English speaker with the fluent Japanese to take you deep into the local scene. This small group tour (6 guests or less -- and it usually is less), combines history with adventure, as you explore the nooks and crannies of these very old parts of this awesome city. You're sure to have a great time getting to know the REAL Osaka.Just around sunset, we'll meet at Tenma Station (on the JR loop line, just one stop from Osaka Station/Umeda), which puts us right in the middle of a very old part of Osaka. First, we'll head to neighboring Ogimachi Park, taking in the views and getting oriented. Then it's time to dive in to Tenma proper! While walking around, your guide will explain the history and context of the area, and all about the culture that thrives here today.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of walking around, we'll stop for our first drink and bit of food for the night, in the heart of Tenma. Food will vary by restaurant and your tastes over the course of the evening, but typical dishes include \"kushi katsu\" (fried food on sticks), \"dote nikomi\" (slow cooked beef... parts), \"tonpei yaki\" (a grilled pork and egg dish), and some healthier things as well -- promise! A bit more walking around Tenma brings us to another great eating and drinking spot, quite different from the first one.\n\nAfter we've thoroughly surveyed Tenma, we'll hop on a train for the short ride to Kyobashi, where the vibe is a bit more raucous, but equally fun! It's an old area, filled to the brim with character. In Kyobashi, we'll walk around about 10 minutes before stopping at a final \"standing bar\" for more food and drink. \n\nOsaka is famous for its food, and you're going to see it all tonight!

Draw once again over the patterns you have drawn to make them look solid. When the fabric you draw the pattern is dyed, the wax cracks and the ink permeates through the cracks, making the unique patterns. You use wax of about 150 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too high, the wax permeates through the cloth, and if it is too low, the wax becomes translucent, which also adds a unique touch to every piece.",
